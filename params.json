{"name":"BAC0","tagline":"BAC0 - Library depending on BACpypes (Python 3) to build automation script for bacnet applications","body":"BAC0 is a Python 3 scripting application that uses BACpypes to process bacnet messages on a IP network. \r\nThis library brings out simple commands to browse a bacnet network, read properties from bacnet devices or write to them.\r\n\r\nPython is a simple language to learn and a very powerful tool for data processing. Coupled to bacnet, it becomes a great \r\ntool to test devices an interact with controllers.\r\n\r\nWhere to download\r\n-----------------\r\nhttps://github.com/ChristianTremblay/bacnetScript\r\n\r\nWhat you need\r\n-------------\r\nBAC0 is based on BACpypes-python3 found here::\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/ChristianTremblay/bacpypes-python3\r\n\r\nThis is a port of the official BACpypes module found here::\r\n    \r\n    svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/bacpypes/code/trunk bacpypes-code\r\n\r\nExcept that it works with Python 3... Yeah, that's why it's called bacpypes-python3... :0)\r\n\r\nHow to install\r\n--------------\r\nOnce the repo has been cloned, use::\r\n\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n\r\nDemo in a Jupyter Notebook\r\n--------------------------\r\nWhen installed, module can be used to script communication with bacnet device.\r\nJupyter Notebooks are an excellent way to test it\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ChristianTremblay/bacnetScript/blob/master/Jupyter/BAC0.ipynb\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
